<h1>Error!</h1>

<p>nginx could not find WROLPi! Are your services running?</p>

<p><b>sudo systemctl status wrolpi-app</b></p>
<p><b>sudo systemctl status wrolpi-api</b></p>

<br/>
<p>If either of those services are not running, start all WROLPi services:</p>

<p><b>sudo systemctl start wrolpi.target</b></p>

<br/>
<p>Or, start them individually:</p>
<p><b>sudo systemctl start wrolpi-app</b></p>
<p><b>sudo systemctl start wrolpi-api</b></p>
