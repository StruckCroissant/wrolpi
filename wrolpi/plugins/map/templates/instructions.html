        <p class="lead">Your offline map isn't quite ready. Follow the steps below to download and setup your
            map.</p>

        <h2>Setup instructions</h2>
        <p>You will first need to download your free map data. This can be a single state, an entire sub-region, or even
            the entire planet.</p>
        <form action="/api/{{ PLUGIN_ROOT }}/pbf" method="post">
            <ol>
                <li>Proceed to <a href="https://download.geofabrik.de/">this external website</a> and choose one of
                    their
                    free
                    PBF files. Copy it's URL.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Beware! This map will be stored on your WROLPi's hard drive in a docker container; don't
                            choose
                            a
                            file that is larger than your drive.
                        </li>
                        <li>For example, I could paste
                            <pre>https://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/us-west-latest.osm.pbf</pre>
                            into the form below, and I would have a map for the entire US West Coast.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Paste the PBF file's URL here:
                    <input type="text" name="pbf_url">
                </li>
                <li>
                    <button class="btn btn-primary" type="submit">Submit</button>
                    this form to download and import your chosen map data!
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you're re-submitting your chosen file, the download will continue from where it left off.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>This will take quite some time (several hours if you've chosen a large file). Come back later and try out
                your shiny offline map!</p>
